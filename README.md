# Employee-Directory

## Description
This repository contains my employee directory with React. The project was a homework assignment from the Case Western Reserve University's Coding Bootcamp. It required me to create a directory that allows you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
